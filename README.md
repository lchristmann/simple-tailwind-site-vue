# Simple Tailwind Theme for Typo3

This project was created with `npm init vite simple-tailwind-site-vue` (choosing Vue and vanilla JavaScript) and `npm install`.

Work with it by checking it out and running `npm install` plus `npm run dev`.

## Todos

- streamline the HTML structure in the About/Blog/Docs/Changelog components, so it's easy to make separate components for the content elements in Typo3 later
